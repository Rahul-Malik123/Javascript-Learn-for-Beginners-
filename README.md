# Learn JavaScript

This repository was made for beginners to start learning Javascript from Scratch

## Documentation

This repository uses [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org) for generating documentation website on the fly.

If you want to run Docsify, you must use the latest version of node (now is v13.0.1).

**Steps:**
1. Install dependencies.
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Then run the following command to serve the documentation.
   ```
   npm run serve-docs
   ```
3. Now you can preview documentation site in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.

## ESLint

After making your changes or adding your contributions, lint your javascript files with eslint by running the following command.
While linting, many errors may arise. Don't try to fix errors from other files except yours as this is a tutorial repo some mistakes are intentional.

```sh
$ npm run lint:fix
```
